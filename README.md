## Overview

As Gardner and Zalisk write,

> [b]y disseminating your story, you can give people a far more accurate view of who you are, which can avert....coordination challenges, interpersonal friction, and misunderstandings down the road...by inserting your career narrative....you can help ensure that when people talk about you - and they will talk about you - they're saying the right things.

And, despite what you might think, we _are_ storytellers -- even if our skills are a bit rusty. As Kleon notes, via author Alison Bechdel, "[w]hatever we say, we're always talking about ourselves": for good or ill.

One way that we can frame or help ourselves understand what we _want_ to do, what we _have done_, and what we're _currently doing_ is to develop a "career narrative." Often, this statement goes unshared; it serves as context that you keep in mind whenever you need to make a professional decision (this goes for artistic choices as well). This is your mission statement, and it should be revisited early and often. 

## Example

So, let's visit the idea for a first time. This assignment asks you to develop a short statement. Let's take the example from the Gardner and Zalisk reading.

### Initial

> I wanted to work in biotech, so that's why I joined the firm. I've had a lot of experience in labs, and I'm still considering graduate school.

### Revised

> I worked in labs through college and entered the firm with a strong interest in health care clients. I've had the opportunity to develop my quantitative financial skills in the comfortable context of health care. Now I'd like to test those skills with other commercial clients to determine what industry most interests me over the long term. That said, given my wife's and my family commitments, I'd really like to work locally if possible.

## Assignment guidelines

Develop your assignment in the `narrative.md` document included with this repository in the `writing` directory.

### Goal

Write a single sentence which clearly identifies the professional or academic goal you'd like to achieve in 6 - 12 months' time.

### Summary 

Create a short summary of your statement which can take the form of either a short simple statement like the [initial example](#Initial), or a bullet-pointed list of objectives you'd like your narrative to cover.

### Draft

Attempt the 75 - 150 word draft of your narrative keeping in mind:

* Use specific references which _support_ your goal via past experience
  * At least one specific example which might be one of:
    * Coursework
    * Internships
    * Employment
* Describe how your latest research, coursework, or professional experience supports your goal
  * At least one specific example which might be one of:
    * A research or class project
    * An internship
* Develop a short statement which restates the work you did in the `Goal` section
  * Phrase this without explicity writing "My goal is..."

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.
